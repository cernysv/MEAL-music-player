This is a music player that is designed to be fast and easy to use.  
Built with WPF, it runs only on Windows for now. I'm planning to expand to Linux later.

* [TagLib](https://github.com/taglib/taglib)
* [.NET libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/)

### Releases

### Known bugs

### My current To-Do list
* Add Shuffle
* Add Loop current song
* Add volume control
* Add custom music folder location (currently Music in the user folder)
* Fix AutoNext()
* Improve the UI

**NOTE**: Might run under Wine on Linux, not confirming yet.
